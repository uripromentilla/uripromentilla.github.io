### What are random variables?

Functions. Variables that are determined by the actual outcome.

It's like Schrodinger's box, but it has a probability distribution.

### What is expectation?

The average value of a random variable given many independent experiments.

Another interpretation is of the average value of a population.

Sum of the probability or weight \* value. For all possible values.

### What is the linearity of expectation?

A linear change in expectation is equal to the expectation of the linear change. i.e. if it's linear, then you can switch the order of execution of expectation and linear functions.

E\[g(x)\] == g(E\[x\]) but this only holds for linear equations.

E\[x^2\] \!= (E\[x\])^2
