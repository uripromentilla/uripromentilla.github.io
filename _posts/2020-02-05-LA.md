### What is a subspace?

All the possible points/area the linear combinations of the column vectors can reach.

Linear subspace = a set, a linear combination should result into still being in that set.

Subspace rule:

1.  Any linear combination should be still in the subspace (or set)

But apparently there some rules to a subspace like:

1.  Must be able to reach a 0 vector/origin.

2.  A line or plane must pass through the origin.
