## What is policy evaluation?

Evaluate how good the policy is by evaluating its value functions.

With inputs: policy, find value functions.

## What is control?

Control the policy to maximize value/rewards.

With inputs: dynamic probabilities and value functions, find optimal policy.

## What is dynamic programming?

A way to compute for the optimal policy and value functions which uses bellman equations.

A substitute to the linear equations solver.
