## What is a subspace?

All the possible points/area the linear combinations of the column vectors can reach.

Linear subspace = a set, a linear combination should result into still being in that set.

Subspace rule:

1.  Any linear combination of an element of the subspace should be still in the subspace.

2.  Must pass through 0/origin.
    
    1.  A line or plane must pass through the origin.
